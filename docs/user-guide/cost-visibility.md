# Cost Visibility
## Introduction

In Devtron, Cost Visibility helps you understand your infrastructure spends. Instead of only using your cloud provider billing dashboards, you can see costs directly within Devtron, broken down by **Applications**, **Clusters**, **Environments**, **Projects**, **Infra Components**.

It tracks spend on **CPU**, **Memory**, **Storage**, **GPU**, **network**, and highlights efficiency along with potential savings. You can view costs in multiple currencies, select daily, monthly, or custom ranges, and navigate from overall spend to specific cost breakdowns.

## Overview

The **Overview** page provides a summary of infrastructure costs across your Applications, Clusters, Environments, Projects, and Infra Components in Devtron. It highlights overall spend, resource-level distribution, and opportunities for optimization (Potential Savings).

At the top, you can choose your preferred currency time and time duration to set the context for your usage costs. This makes sure all costs on the **Overview** page are displayed in the correct currency and time range.
